# Payment For Fuel Using The License Plate System

## ü•à Awarded second place in the Ma≈Çopolska region's "Ma≈Çopolski Konkurs W≈Çasnych Prac Technicznych" competition in the Computer Science category.





## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comfortable and efficient fuel payment experience for customers. The system consists of three interconnected applications:

### Web Application "Station"
A Django-based web application for customer registration and payment processing.

### Mobile Application "Station App"
A Flutter-based mobile app for fuel payment and loyalty program management.

### Artificial Intelligence for Vehicle License Plate Recognition
A TensorFlow and OpenCV-based system for automatic number plate recognition (ANPR).

## How it Works
----------------

### Fuel Payment

1. Customer registration and vehicle registration on the web application.
2. ANPR system reads the vehicle's license plate using a camera.
3. Data is sent to the web application, which initiates the payment process.
4. The user opens the mobile app, and a payment window appears within seconds.

* A loyalty program is initiated when a user profile is created.
* Points earned during fuel purchases can be redeemed for various products.

## Technical Operation
---------------------

### Technologies Used

* **Django**: Web Application "Station"
* **Flutter**: Mobile Application "Station App"
* **TensorFlow & OpenCV**: Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)
* **PostgreSQL**: Database

### Detailed Explanation

* The web application uses Django Rest Framework for REST API development and PostgreSQL for database management.
* The ANPR system uses TensorFlow Object Detection and EasyOCR for license plate recognition.
* The mobile application uses Django Simple JWT for secure user login and authorization.

## Practical Usage Examples
---------------------------

* The project can be integrated with a gas station to provide convenient fuel payment and loyalty program management.
* Customers can use the system to make efficient fuel payments without leaving their vehicle.
* The loyalty program encourages repeat customer visits and rewards point collection.
